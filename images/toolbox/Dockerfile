# Use K8s pause binary as the default command.
# This is convenient when using this Docker image to run a K8s Pod which is meant to be exec'ed
# into, as there is no need to specify an explicit command when deploying the Pod.
# "pause" is superior to a simple "sleep infinity", as it handled signals correctly.
# Note that pause is a static binary.
